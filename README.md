# My Cloud Resume
This repository contains the code for my online portfolio website, which showcases my resume, skills, and experience. The website is built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript, and it is hosted on AWS S3.

The website is divided into the following sections:

Resume: This section contains my resume, which is written downloadable in pdf format.
Skills: This section lists my skills, including programming languages, frameworks, and tools.
Experience: This section lists my work experience, including the companies I have worked for, the roles I have held, and the projects I have worked on.
Education: This section lists my educational background, including the schools I have attended and the degrees and certifications I have earned.
Projects: This section lists my personal projects, which I have developed to showcase my skills and creativity.

I am always updating my website with new content, so please check back often.
